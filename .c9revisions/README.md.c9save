This application is meant to be used as a starting place for those\nlooking to get their feet wet with ZF2.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nUsing Composer (recommended)\n----------------------------\nThe recommended way to get a working copy of this project is to clone the repository\nand use `composer` to install dependencies using the `create-project` command:\n\n    curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php --\n    php composer.phar create-project -sdev --repository-url=\"http://packages.zendframework.com\" zendframework/skeleton-application path/to/install\n\nAlternately, clone the repository and manually invoke `composer` using the shipped\n`composer.phar`:\n\n    cd my/project/dir\n    git clone git://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication.git\n    cd ZendSkeletonApplication\n    php composer.phar self-update\n    php composer.phar install\n\n(The `self-update` directive is to ensure you have an up-to-date `composer.phar`\navailable.)\n\nAnother alternative for downloading the project is to grab it via `curl`, and\nthen pass it to `tar`:\n\n    cd my/project/dir\n    curl -#L https://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication/tarball/master | tar xz --strip-components=1\n\nYou would then invoke `composer` to install dependencies per the previous\nexample.\n\nUsing Git submodules\n--------------------\nAlternatively, you can install using native git submodules:\n\n    git clone git://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication.git --recursive\n\nVirtual Host\n------------\nAfterwards, set up a virtual host to point to the public/ directory of the\nproject and you should be ready to go!"]],"start1":15,"start2":15,"length1":16,"length2":1782}]],"length":1797,"saved":false}
